 Project Overview: On-Demand Food Delivery System UI
This project is a front-end interface design for an on-demand food delivery application named QuickBite. Built using HTML and CSS, the goal is to deliver a sleek, user-friendly experience tailored to the modern food ordering journey.

 Objective
Create an intuitive and responsive UI that enables users to:
- Browse and customize their food orders
- View real-time delivery status updates
- Navigate the platform easily across desktop and mobile

 Key Features
- Order Customization Form – Dropdown menu for dish selection and checkboxes for add-ons like cheese, sauces, and cutlery.
- Delivery Status Tracker – Visually represents each stage of the order with highlight colors (e.g., “On the Way” in orange, “Delivered” pending).
- Navigation Menu – Clean header with quick access to Menu, Order Tracking, and Cart.
- Responsive Layout – Mobile-friendly design with consistent theming and accessible UI elements.
